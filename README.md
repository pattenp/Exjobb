This Repository contains the source code for a TODO application written in Svelte and React. The applications are located in the apps folder. I recommend PNPM to manage dependencies but NPM works aswell.

To install dependencies run PNPM install in root folder. If using npm navigate to each project in apps and run NPM install in respective folder.
